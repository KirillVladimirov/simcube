      "Promotion of hygiene might be the single most costeff ective way of reducing the global burden of infectious disease.\n",
      "1 One might therefore expect hygiene to be the subject of multimillion dollar international initiatives like those for malaria or HIV/AIDS prevention.\n",
      "Perhaps because hygiene does not require clever new technologies or products, or perhaps because it is a domestic and personal issue largely aff ecting women and children, and perhaps because it concerns the neglected diarrhoeal and respiratory diseases (still the two biggest killers of children)\n",
      ", hygiene is still very much overlooked in public health.\n",
      "There are signs that the situation is beginning to improve.\n",
      "Governments and funding agencies increasingly accept that hygiene promotion should play a part in health investments across the wider community, not just in health-care settings.\n",
      "Policy makers are also realising that the health benefi ts of increased investment in water and sanitation infrastructure are largely delivered through improvements in personal and domestic hygiene.\n",
      "2 Original approaches using new insights are modernising the hygiene sector, making it more attractive to investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Improved water supplies and sanitation facilities make it easier to practise hygiene, keeping children and adults safe from infection.\n",
      "But even without improved facilities, better hygiene can still make a huge diff erence to health.\n",
      "Although most sanitation and water supply programme implementers seek to improve hygiene alongside hardware, they rarely have the resources and professional support needed to do this eff ectively.\n",
      "Health professionals recognise the need for better hygiene, but too few are actually engaged in programmes to promote it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this Review we gather the facts about the importance of hygiene for public health and explore the scale of the problem.\n",
      "We set out what we know about hygiene and assess its promotion in the service of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and beyond.\n",
      "Growing understanding of what shapes hygiene behaviour and creative partnerships are changing the way improvement is being approached.\n",
      "The evidence for giving hygiene a much higher priority is strong, and, to a large extent, we already know what needs to be done.\n",
      "The most important ingredient still missing is the full and active engagement of the health sector in improving global hygiene.\n",
      "\n",
      "Improvements in hygiene, sanitation, and water can prevent several important infections, in addition to providing other benefi ts.\n",
      "Among these avoidable infections prevention of diarrhoeal diseases is most important.\n",
      "Because the source of infections is human faecal material, the most important hygiene behaviours are clearly those that keep faecal matter out of the domestic environment.\n",
      "Adequate handwashing after contact with faeces is also crucial (after one's own defecation, after handling the faeces of children, or after contact with a faeces-contaminated environment).\n",
      "Other ways of preventing the faecal-oral transmission of infections include keeping water, foods, and surfaces free of faecal contamination and preventing carriage by fl ies.\n",
      "Safe food handling and preparation is also important, especially for children, as is the avoidance of animal faeces and the safe storage and use of water.\n",
      "3 Other diseases that can be prevented by adequate hygiene include respiratory infections, trachoma, and skin infections.\n",
      "Endoparasites, such as roundworm and hookworm, and ectoparasites including scabies and fl eas, can also be avoided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Public health practitioners commonly use information from four sources when weighing up the risk of infectious disease.\n",
      "First, they can assess the biological likelihood that a particular practice will place individuals at risk of infection.\n",
      "Second, they can use risk mapping-for example, modelling of the transfer of microbes between surfaces and hosts in homes and hospitals 4 or use of the hazard analysis critical control points method for assessing risk in food preparation.\n",
      "5\n",
      "However, these approaches depend on access to good estimates of environmental contamination, which are largely unavailable for developing countries.\n",
      "Third, health practitioners can use correlations between recorded practices and disease incidence from observational studies.\n",
      "These data are more readily available, but can be misleading.\n",
      "6 Hygiene behaviour is commonly associated with socioeconomic factors, such as wealth, education, Review access to water, and modern lifestyle attitudes, 7 all of which infl uence the risk of infectious disease.\n",
      "Such strong socioeconomic confounding is diffi cult, if not impossible, to address analytically.\n",
      "8\n",
      "The fourth source of information for public health policy making is randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which control for confounding.\n",
      "However, very few RCTs of hygiene promotion programmes have been undertaken in developing countries, and those that have been done have several methodological fl aws.\n",
      "For example, the masking of participants to the intervention is diffi cult, and as a result, mothers who are grateful for an intervention may be less likely to report disease in their children, leading to infl ated eff ect sizes.\n",
      "9 Bias is thus a serious issue in unblinded studies on diarrhoea.\n",
      "10\n",
      "Given these caveats, what can we say about the prevention of diarrhoeal disease through hygiene?\n",
      "Table 1 draws together our assessment of the available evidence, from reviews and other key papers, concerning the four sources of information: biological plausibility, risk modelling, observational studies, and RCTs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best studied hygiene practice in developing countries is that of handwashing.\n",
      "Evidence from all four types of source is consistent, with RCTs of handwashing interventions showing reductions in diarrhoea of around 30%, and of 43-47% if soap is used.\n",
      "11, 12 Handwashing can also reduce other infections; one review suggested it could reduce respiratory infection by 16%, 13 and a more recent cluster-randomised trial in Pakistan reported a reduction in acute lower respiratory tract infections of 50%.\n",
      "14 Handwashing also reduces neonatal mortality, 15 trachoma, 16 and parasitic worm infections.\n",
      "17 Face or whole-body washing are less well researched but might help to control skin infections and trachoma.\n",
      "18\n",
      "An unclean face is associated with increased risk of trachoma, 19, 20 and a randomised trial suggested that face washing reduces the risk of severe trachoma infection substantially.\n",
      "21 Handwashing with soap mitigated the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic 22 and is one of the key practices recommended to counter possible infl uenza pandemics.\n",
      "23\n",
      "Although food-borne infection is the main route of transmission of gastrointestinal infections in developed countries, their contribution to the burden of diarrhoea in low-income settings is unclear.\n",
      "Hot climates, poor storage facilities, and faecal contamination of the environment all make food-borne infection more likely.\n",
      "Therefore, food-borne infections are likely to play a major part in diarrhoeal disease transmission in low-income settings.\n",
      "24 Microbiological studies have shown the ability of many pathogens to grow quickly in food, especially in hot climates.\n",
      "24, 25 Contaminated weaning food, in particular, has been suggested as a major contributor to diarrhoea in low-income settings, 26 although observational studies gave inconclusive results.\n",
      "24\n",
      "Most of what we assume about food-borne infections in low-income settings is based on expert opinion and biological plausibility, rather than fi eld data (\n",
      "eg, WHO's manual Five Keys to Safer Food).\n",
      "27\n",
      "Several trials have assessed the eff ect of promoting exclusive breastfeeding on food-borne infections, with equivocal results.\n",
      "28, 29 Food hygiene interventions have rarely been systematically tested.\n",
      "In one of the very few intervention studies of improving childhood feeding practices, which included some food-hygiene education, Bhandari and colleagues 30 found little eff ect on the nutritional status of children in rural India.\n",
      "The results of a recent trial done in Mali suggested that the microbiological safety of weaning food could be signifi cantly improved with hazard-control principles in homes.\n",
      "31 Other routes of infection that could be removed by better hygiene are related to contact with child 7,32,33 and animal faeces.\n",
      "34\n",
      "A meta-analysis of observational studies of hygiene practices associated with child faeces found that failure to remove child faeces and unhygienic handling practices were associated with a 23% increased risk of diarrhoea.\n",
      "35 Other observational studies have reported that animals kept in shared outdoor living spaces (compounds) increase the risk of diarrhoea by over 50%.\n",
      "[36] [37]\n",
      "[38]\n",
      "However, no studies that we know of have quantifi ed the risks associated with the use of cow dung for fuel or in house maintenance.\n",
      "So far no intervention trials have aimed to reduce animal faecal contamination in domestic spaces.\n",
      "Neither are there any reports of trials of improving the disposal of child faeces by use of potties, nappies, or child-friendly toilets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Household surfaces seem to play a major part in disease transmission, although most evidence is from developed countries, [39] [40] [41] and few intervention studies have tested whether surface cleansing can reduce transmission in any setting.\n",
      "Larson \n",
      "with similar products without an antibacterial agent, and found no additional benefi t.\n",
      "However, a small study in a school setting suggested that regular cleaning of desks and other classroom surfaces reduces the risk of gastrointestinal illness.\n",
      "43 Epidemiological evidence of the health risk associated with solid-waste disposal in low-income settings is scarce.\n",
      "Observational studies have shown a strong link between environmental exposure to solid waste and diarrhoea, 44 perhaps because waste heaps are sometimes used for open defecation and disposal of excreta.\n",
      "In addition to attracting insect vectors and fl ies, waste is associated with Lassa fever infection which is transmitted by rats.\n",
      "45\n",
      "In some settings fl y control might reduce diarrhoea risk by around 25%, [46]\n",
      "[47] [48] and lessen the risk of trachoma.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because there are multiple routes for the transmission of gastroenteric pathogens, many hygiene intervention studies have targeted several behaviours at once.\n",
      "Such an approach can dilute the eff ect of the intervention.\n",
      "For example, Haggerty and co-workers 49 did a large clusterrandomised trial to test the eff ect of promoting four diff erent hygiene behaviours (handwashing after faecal contact, handwashing before food contact, disposal of animal faeces, and disposal of child faeces).\n",
      "No eff ect on diarrhoea was reported in this study, perhaps suggesting that changing four distinct hygiene practices over a short time is unrealistic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biological plausibility of most hygiene interventions is high (table 1) ; there is, however, a major shortage of evidence from trials.\n",
      "Trials on this topic can be complex and the results misleading; it is hard to mask participants to the nature of the intervention, which can lead to bias in outcome reporting.\n",
      "One way to improve this situation is to use more objective out come measures, such as health-care seeking, assessments by health-care workers masked to intervention status, or mortality.\n",

      "56 Hygiene habits were learnt at an early age, but soap use was rarely taught by parents or schools.\n",
      "Key motivations for handwashing were disgust of contamination on hands and to do what everyone else was perceived to be doing (social norms).\n",

      "Aunger and colleagues 68 observed that habit was the most powerful determinant of handwashing in Kenya, followed by several motives including disgust, and social norms, and cognitive plans to save money.\n",
      "An investigation into nurses' handwashing in Australia saw evidence of a similar distinction between planned and motivated or habitual handwashing behaviour.\n",
      "69\n",
      "A study of routine behaviour and hygiene in rural India suggested that some handwashing behaviours are deeply embedded in daily routines and hence highly habitual, whereas others are motivated by the transient disgust or discomfort of having dirty hands.\n",
      "70\n",
      "The psychological factors determining hygiene are related to factors in the environment.\n",
      "For example, when local social norms are the source of poor handwashing habits people commonly practise what they perceive everyone else to be doing, which reinforces the norm of not using soap.\n",
      "Lack of water and a perception that soap is too expensive for handwashing could also constrain handwashing (though this might be post-rationalisation because one review suggested that soap was present in 97% of all households in a review, but it was used mainly for clothes, body, and dish washing).\n",
      "56\n",
      "Finally, fear of epidemics such as cholera or severe acute respiratory syndrome (but not of endemic diarrhoeas that cause far more deaths) could also lead to improved hygiene.\n",
      "56\n",
      "Although an understanding of the determinants of handwashing behaviour is helpful, how such insight can be used in behaviour change programmes is not always obvious.\n",
      "The fi gure summarises the psychological and environmental factors that are likely to determine hygiene behaviour.\n",
      "56\n",
      "If much handwashing is habitual, then the cues that trigger these habits need to be found and the habits established at an early age.\n",
      "Environmental changes that make handwashing easier and cheaper, such as the introduction of simple water-saving technologies (eg, socalled tippy taps), could be helpful (although how their use could become widespread is unclear), as could information suggesting that handwashing with soap is a desirable social norm where it is not one.\n",

      "However, large-scale engineering programmes are rarely equipped to handle what they call the software (ie, the behavioural) side of development.\n",
      "Equally, the most eff ective use of a hygiene budget might be to cover larger areas by use of mass media, rather than to restrict eff orts to villages in the process of acquiring new water facilities.\n",
      "Hygiene messages should always be integral to eff orts promoting improved sanitation.\n",
      "Ministries of health can play a part by insisting that it is not acceptable to build toilets in schools, health facilities, workplaces, and homes without appropriate hand washing facilities.\n",

      "The capacity to implement medium-scale programmes needs to be built through learning by doing.\n",
      "Programmes of research led by local universities, with international support where needed, can begin to tackle these multiple issues.\n",
